    <p>
      The spread of European education in alliance with the doctrine of
      Christianity had been an important impetus to missionary enterprise in
      India in the nineteenth century. Scottish Church College, established in
      1830 as the General Assembly's Institution and given its present name in
      1929 is an institution born out of one such impetus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The college founder, Rev. Alexander Duff, was the first missionary to
      India from the Church of Scotland. His idea was to set up an institution
      which linked western education with Christian mission and the eventual
      progress of the people -- years later the College is committed to the
      vision of its founding father and aims at academic excellence alongwith
      social awareness and character building.
    </p>
    <p>
      The College is the second oldest in North Calcutta and has produced
      numerous outstanding people, chief among them being Swami Vivekananda and
      Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. The college also enjoys the status of College
      with Potential for Excellence, a quality rating by the University Grants
      Commission. Media survey rates Scottish as one among the top fifty
      colleges in India.
    </p>
    <p>
      The College is now owned and administered by the Church of North India
      (CNI) through the diocese of Calcutta. It is affiliated to the University
      of Calcutta but enjoys autonomous status for its Faculty of Post Graduate
      Studies. We offer Honours course in 15 subjects in the under-graduate
      stream and post-graduate course in two subjects. The Department of Teacher
      Education of the college prepares women students for the Bachelor of
      Education degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      In keeping with the vision of its founder, the Scottish Church College
      encouraged academic excellence as well as promoting personality
      development, community service and the refinement of aesthetic
      sensibilities. Through the years a long line of illustrious personalities
      have been educated in these hallowed halls of learning. The splendorous
      architecture of the College including its magnificent prayer hall is
      eloquent testimony to its timeless heritage and the pioneering vision of
      its founding fathers.
